## Phase 1: Core Curriculum Infrastructure

### Step 1.1: Enhanced Curriculum Base Class
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Files**: `rl_board_games/core/curriculum.py`
**Implemented Features**:
- `CurriculumLevel` dataclass for level definitions
- `CurriculumState` for tracking progress with save/load functionality
- `DifficultyLookup` for efficient seed -> solve length mapping
- `ProgressiveCurriculum` base class with difficulty progression logic
- Curriculum metrics collection and state persistence

### Step 1.2: Ricochet Robots Curriculum Implementation
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Files**: `rl_board_games/curricula/ricochet_robots_curriculum.py`
**Implemented Features**:
- `RicochetRobotsCurriculum` class with 5 default difficulty levels
- Efficient game generation using difficulty lookup
- Fallback mechanism for missing lookup data
- Curriculum statistics and analysis methods

### Step 1.3: Difficulty Generator Utility
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Files**: `rl_board_games/core/difficulty_generator.py`, `scripts/generate_difficulty_lookup.py`
**Implemented Features**:
- Pre-computation of solve lengths using A* solver
- Configurable board sizes and robot counts
- Batch generation for standard configurations
- Difficulty distribution analysis
- Command-line interface for easy usage
- Standalone script for easy execution

### Step 1.4: Comprehensive Testing
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Files**: `tests/curricula/test_ricochet_curriculum.py`
**Test Coverage**:
- DifficultyLookup save/load functionality
- CurriculumLevel and CurriculumState serialization
- Curriculum progression logic
- Game generation from difficulty levels
- State persistence and recovery
- Metrics collection
- 12 tests all passing

### Production Efficiency Approach ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Challenge**: Avoid recreating difficulty environments during training
**Solution**: Pre-computed difficulty lookup system
- **Approach**: Seed -> solve length mapping for different board configurations
- **Benefits**: O(1) difficulty lookup, deterministic puzzle generation, cacheable
- **Implementation**: JSON lookup tables for different (board_size, num_robots) combinations
- **Storage**: `difficulty_lookup/lookup_{size}x{size}_{robots}robots.json`
- **Performance**: Instant difficulty classification during training

### Technical Decisions Made
- Using A* solver to pre-compute optimal solve lengths for puzzle difficulty classification
- Lookup table structure: `{seed: solve_length}` per configuration file
- Difficulty thresholds based on solve length ranges per level
- Fallback to random generation if seed not in lookup table
- 5-level curriculum: Easy (1-3 moves) → Medium (3-6) → Hard (5-10) → Expert (8-15) → Master (10-20)
- Progressive board sizes: 4x4 → 6x6 → 8x8 → 12x12 → 16x16
- Adaptive success thresholds: 90% → 80% → 70% → 60% → 50%

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Create script to generate standard lookup tables
2. 🔄 Integrate curriculum with training pipeline
3. 🔄 Update configuration system for curriculum parameters
4. ✅ Create comprehensive tests
5. ⏳ Add curriculum visualization tools
6. ⏳ Generate sample difficulty lookup tables for testing
