# Implementation Plan: Curriculum Learning for Ricochet Robots

## Selected Feature: Curriculum Learning
**Why this feature**: Curriculum learning is a natural next step that can significantly improve training efficiency and agent performance. It's well-suited to Ricochet Robots where we can progressively increase difficulty from simple to complex scenarios.

## Overview
Implement a curriculum learning system that progressively trains agents on increasingly difficult Ricochet Robots puzzles, starting with simple configurations and advancing to complex multi-robot scenarios.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Curriculum Infrastructure (Days 1-2)

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Curriculum Base Class
- **File**: `rl_board_games/core/curriculum.py`
- **Tasks**:
  - Extend existing curriculum class with difficulty progression logic
  - Add curriculum state tracking (current difficulty, progression criteria)
  - Implement curriculum metrics collection
  - Add curriculum configuration loading from YAML

#### Step 1.2: Ricochet Robots Curriculum Implementation
- **File**: `rl_board_games/curricula/ricochet_robots_curriculum.py`
- **Tasks**:
  - Create difficulty levels (Easy → Medium → Hard → Expert)
  - Implement puzzle generation for each difficulty level
  - Define progression criteria (success rate thresholds)
  - Add difficulty-specific metrics tracking

### Phase 2: Difficulty Level Definitions (Days 2-3)

#### Step 2.1: Easy Level (Starter Curriculum)
- **Characteristics**:
  - 4x4 or 6x6 board size
  - 1-2 robots only
  - Minimal walls (sparse maze)
  - Target within 3-5 moves
  - High success rate required: 90%+

#### Step 2.2: Medium Level
- **Characteristics**:
  - 8x8 board size
  - 2-3 robots
  - Moderate wall density
  - Target within 5-8 moves
  - Success rate threshold: 80%+

#### Step 2.3: Hard Level
- **Characteristics**:
  - 12x12 board size
  - 3-4 robots
  - Complex wall patterns
  - Target within 8-12 moves
  - Success rate threshold: 70%+

#### Step 2.4: Expert Level
- **Characteristics**:
  - 16x16 board size (current default)
  - 4+ robots
  - Dense wall configurations
  - Target within 12+ moves
  - Success rate threshold: 60%+

### Phase 3: Integration with Training Pipeline (Days 3-4)

#### Step 3.1: Trainer Modifications
- **File**: `rl_board_games/training/trainer.py`
- **Tasks**:
  - Add curriculum progression logic to training loop
  - Implement curriculum level advancement triggers
  - Add curriculum-specific logging and metrics
  - Create curriculum reset functionality

#### Step 3.2: Environment Integration
- **File**: `rl_board_games/training/ricochet_robots_env.py`
- **Tasks**:
  - Modify environment to accept curriculum-generated puzzles
  - Add curriculum-aware episode generation
  - Implement curriculum state tracking in environment

### Phase 4: Configuration and Utilities (Days 4-5)

#### Step 4.1: Configuration System
- **File**: `configs/ricochet_robots/dqn_curriculum.yaml`
- **Tasks**:
  - Create curriculum-enabled training configuration
  - Define curriculum parameters and thresholds
  - Add curriculum logging configuration

#### Step 4.2: Evaluation Framework
- **File**: `rl_board_games/core/curriculum_evaluator.py`
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement curriculum-aware evaluation
  - Add cross-difficulty performance testing
  - Create curriculum progression visualization tools

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation (Days 5-6)

#### Step 5.1: Unit Tests
- **Files**: `tests/curricula/test_ricochet_curriculum.py`
- **Tasks**:
  - Test curriculum progression logic
  - Validate difficulty level generation
  - Test curriculum state persistence

#### Step 5.2: Integration Tests
- **Files**: `tests/training/test_curriculum_training.py`
- **Tasks**:
  - Test end-to-end curriculum training
  - Validate curriculum metrics collection
  - Test curriculum configuration loading

### Phase 6: Documentation and Examples (Days 6-7)

#### Step 6.1: Documentation
- **Files**: Update existing docs and README
- **Tasks**:
  - Document curriculum learning implementation
  - Add curriculum configuration examples
  - Create curriculum training guide

#### Step 6.2: Example Scripts
- **File**: `scripts/train_curriculum.py`
- **Tasks**:
  - Create curriculum training script
  - Add curriculum evaluation script
  - Provide curriculum configuration examples

## Success Metrics
- **Training Efficiency**: 30-50% faster convergence compared to standard training
- **Final Performance**: 10-20% improvement in success rate on expert-level puzzles
- **Stability**: Consistent performance across all difficulty levels
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new difficulty levels

## Technical Considerations
- **Memory Usage**: Curriculum state tracking should be memory-efficient
- **Checkpointing**: Curriculum state must be saved/restored with model checkpoints
- **Flexibility**: System should support easy modification of difficulty parameters
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for curriculum progression analysis

## Risk Mitigation
- **Fallback**: Maintain compatibility with non-curriculum training
- **Validation**: Extensive testing on each difficulty level
- **Gradual Rollout**: Test on small configurations before full implementation
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation for future maintenance

## Expected Timeline: 6-7 days
This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing curriculum learning that will significantly enhance the training capabilities of the RL Board Games framework.
