# RL Board Games - Project Summary

## Overview
This is a reinforcement learning framework for board games, currently focused on **Ricochet Robots**. The project implements a clean, modular architecture that allows training different RL agents (DQN, PPO) on board game environments using the Stable Baselines3 library.

## Core Architecture

### Key Components:
- **Games**: Implementation of board games with standardized interfaces
- **Agents**: RL agents (DQN, PPO) and heuristic agents (A* search, random)
- **Encoders**: State representation converters (flat array, planar)
- **Training**: Gym-compatible environments and training orchestration
- **Persistence**: Checkpoint management and model saving

### Current Game: Ricochet Robots
- 4 robots on a 16x16 board with walls
- Goal: Get a specific robot to a target position
- Reward: -1 per move, +100 for success
- State encoding options: flat array or planar representation

## Technical Stack
- **RL Framework**: Stable Baselines3 (DQN, PPO)
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch
