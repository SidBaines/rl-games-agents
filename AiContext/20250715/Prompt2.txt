This all seems amazing. Please can you go ahead and begin writing the code, carrying out the first stage. I have created a python virtual environment, which is located in /data/atlas/baines/robots-venv (so can be activated by calling "source /data/atlas/baines/robots-venv/bin/activate"), in case you need to use this. Please also keep a detailed record of your progress in a file labelled with todays date inside the folder AiContext, so that future iterations of you can understand your plans & what you have done.
