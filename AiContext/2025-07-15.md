# Progress log – 2025-07-15

## Context
Initial repository scaffolding for RL Board Games project. Milestone 1 in roadmap.

## Actions completed
1. Created package `rl_board_games` with core sub-package.
2. Added abstract base classes:
   • Game, GameState  
   • Agent  
   • Encoder  
   • Curriculum  
   • HeuristicSolver  
   • CheckpointManager (basic pickle/JSON saving)
3. Added empty utils placeholder.
4. Added dependencies list in `requirements.txt`.
5. Established directory skeleton (`games/`, `agents/`, `training/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `AiContext/`) – actual modules will be populated in later milestones.

## Next steps
– Implement Ricochet Robots game engine (`games/ricochet_robots`): board representation, step logic, A* solver.  
– Build SB3 agent wrapper and YAML-driven training script.  
– Set up CI (GitHub Actions) and pre-commit hooks.  
– Expand unit tests for core abstractions.
