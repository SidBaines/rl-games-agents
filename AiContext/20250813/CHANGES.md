- Added min constraints for A* plan curriculum levels:
  - PlanCurriculumLevel now supports `min_total_moves` and `min_robots_moved`.
  - Sampling and predicate logic updated to enforce mins in combination with solve-length window.
  - PlanDifficultyCache `sample_seed_by_constraints` now accepts `min_robots_moved` and enumerates combos accordingly.
  - Updated scripts `generate_plan_cache.py` and `train_curriculum.py` to parse and enforce new fields.
  - Extended example YAML `configs/ricochet_robots/ppo_astar_curruculum.yaml` to document new fields.
