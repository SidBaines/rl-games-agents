- Updated `rl_board_games/core/plan_cache.py` to maintain per-(total_moves, robots_moved) files alongside the existing per-seed index. Added `sample_seed_by_constraints` to randomly select seeds from combination files based on level constraints.
- Modified `rl_board_games/curricula/astar_plan_curriculum.py` to prefer sampling via the new combination files, with fallback to predicate-based scan.
- Changed `scripts/generate_plan_cache.py` to write every solved game to the cache (recording per-combination files) instead of only those that satisfy a particular level.
- New combo file naming: `plan_lookup_{WxH}_{R}robots_moves{m}_robots{r}.json` containing a JSON list of seeds.
- Behavior for levels like <=5 moves and <=2 robots: curriculum now samples a random (moves, robots) combo in the allowed set and then a random seed from the corresponding file.
